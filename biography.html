        <h2>Basic information about me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Bahaban Maxence. I was born on March 4th 2003 in France, Gonesse (95). As I was 1 year old, my family moved in Gironde (33) in the South-West of France. I lived there during most of my life. 
          Recently I moved to Ottawa in Canada for my studies in Journalism. It's my 2 years here. As for my family, they moved in Montreal last September so I am still close to them and can visit them during weekends and vacations. </p>
          <h2>My hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love basketball, I play it since I'm 5 years old. Due to that, I spent a considerable amount of time in Langon, the city of my basketball club. 
          When I grew older I basically lived in the gym during saturdays. I did it because I had my games with my team but also because I began to referee games for my club, something I found really enjoyable and continue to do, here, at the university each monday, tuesday and wednesday nights.
          <br/><br/>
           I also love reading since I learnt to do it, my first "big" readings is <abbr title="Harry Potter">HP</abbr> when I was in primary school. 
           I really enjoy fictional books the most but I sometimes read other style of books like, for exemple, the books of Agatha Christie. 
           I would say that my favorite reading is <em>Eragon</em> of Cristopher Paolini. I really admire this author because he wrote his first book really young. 
           Aside from him, I also like Rick Riordan's books. His books, while fictional, help me learn abouth mythology and develop a passion about the myths. </p>
           <br/>
           <p><strong>That is all about me. I hope you enjoy my website.</strong></p>
