        <h1>Presentation of the website</h1>
        <p class="intropara"><strong>This website goal is to share any news about uOttawa sports teams.</p>
        <p class="intropara2">The second goal is as important as the first and it's to show some support to ours teams.</strong></p>
        <p>Let's go Gee-Gees</p>

        <h2>Why did I create the website</h2>
        <p>As a student of <abbr title="University of Ottawa">uOttawa</abbr> I had the opportunity to go to a few games of basketball, football and soccer.
           At those games, I really liked how the students are standing for the university teams, how those teams bring the student community closer.
           That's why I wanted to create a website about them and here we are. 
           I hope that this website could become in the future a sharing place about ours sports teams, maybe even expend it to cover for intramuros leagues.  </p>

        <h2>What will be shared on it ?</h2>
        <p>On this site, I planned to share a lot of things, here is a list:
          <ul>
            <li>share results of game</li>
            <li>news about the teams</li>
            <li>schedules of games</li>
            <li>resume of games I went to</li>
          </ul>
        <p>If you have any proposition about fonctionalities that you want to see added, don't hesitate to conatct me by my mail.</p>
        <h2>A bit of history</h2>
        On the Gee-Gees site, we can find a bit of history pertaining the colors and logo of our university sports teams.
        <blockquote cite="https://teams.geegees.ca/clubs/news">Founded in 1848, the University of Ottawa adopted Garnet and Grey as its official colours and like many nineteenth-century institutions the school's teams were initially known only by the colours.
           Eventually, a connection was made between the shorthand "GG" and "Gee-Gee", the common British nickname for a racehorse. 
           The unique Gee-Gees name and iconic logo known today is a result of over 170 years of history in Ottawa. </blockquote>
